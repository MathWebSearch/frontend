[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MathWebSearch/frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MathWebSearch/frontend)

A frontend for the MWS search engine using NextJS and TypeScript

## Configuring
The configuring is done with various environment variables:
  - REACT_APP_MWS_MODE if set to **'API'** then a mwsapid daemon is expected in the backend otherwise a MWS daemon is expected (default)
  - REACT_APP_MWSAPI_URL set the url of the [MWSAPI daemon](https://github.com/MathWebSearch/mwsapi) (default: localhost:3001)
  - REACT_APP_MWS_URL sets the url of the [MWS daemon](https://github.com/MathWebSearch/mws) (default: localhost:9090)
  - REACT_APP_LATEXML_URL url for the [LaTeXML daemon](https://github.com/MathWebSearch/latexml-mws-docker) (default: localhost:8080)

  - REACT_APP_MWS_BRANDING_TITLE sets the title in the header
  - REACT_APP_MWS_BRANDING_URL sets the url when clicked on this title
  - REACT_APP_DISABLE_EXAMPLES when set to **'true'** disables the example button (by default not set)
  - REACT_APP_DISABLE_SYMBOLS when set to **'true'** disables the symbols button (by default not set)
  - REACT_APP_THEME_NR set to {1, 2, 3} for choosing the {green, blue, red} theme (green default)

      ```
      starts an development server on http://localhost:3000

   -
      ```
      $ yarn install
      $ yarn build
